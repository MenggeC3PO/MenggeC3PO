# Hello, I'm Mengkun Zhang üëã

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

## About Me üéì

As a final-year electrical engineering undergraduate at Southwest Jiaotong University, I have great passion in wireless communications and signal processing. This institution, renowned for its leadership in transportation and topology, has been the cornerstone of my academic journey.

üåâ Currently, I stand on the precipice of academic advancement, aspiring to delve deeper into the realm of technology. I am actively seeking to expand my horizons through a Master's program in Belgium or the Netherlands, with a keen interest in the symbiosis of artificial intelligence and wireless communication to foster groundbreaking solutions in joint communication and sensing.
