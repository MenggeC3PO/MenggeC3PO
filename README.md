# Hello, I'm Mengge Zhang 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

## About Me 🎓
As a final-year undergraduate with a passion for Electronics, AI, and signal processing, I am actively seeking to expand my horizons through a Master's program in Belgium or the Netherlands.
I'm super interested in how AI can make wireless communication even cooler, especially when it comes to intergrated sensing and communication (ISAC) to innovate how we perceive and interact with the world.

## What I'm Good At 💻
- **Coding Skills**: Well-versed in C and Matlab, with practical experience in C++, Python, and HTML.
- **Hardware Savvy**: Proficient with Arduino, STM32, DSP processors, and PCB design.
- **Wireless Communication**: A solid understanding of wireless communication, internet-of-things, signal processing, and both digital and analog electronics.
